TicTacToe
=========

A text-based tic tac toe game. 

There is a course offered at a university nearby called "Survey of Programming Languages." This course has two identical assignments, changing which programming languages are required to complete them. The first half of the assignment is to complete a text-based tic tac toe game entirely in one of the two language options. 

I am not currently a student of that university, but I sort of figured that if a professor at a university thought this would demonstrate a base knowledge of a language to even the slightest extent, I should probably try it. 

I completed this last year and have not touched it since. I don't plan on working on it either, because it's not really important. Sometimes I look at it to remind myself of how two dimensional arrays are passed in functions.

Thanks?
